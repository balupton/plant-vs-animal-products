# A comparison of animal vs plant products

For those raising questions about the comparison between plant products and animal products (as you should! always important to make informed decisions), here is the criteria I used:


## Goals
This listing/comparison aims to be an argument proof factual listing of things going on, with the hopes remove all misinformation about plants vs animal products beyond and reasonable doubt. Constructive positive comments welcome below. If you have something negative to say, try and think of an educational way of putting it, rather than an ego stroking "I'm right, you're wrong way" that just causes unecessary defenses. Thanks!


## Ecology

### All Animals
Animal production for our benefit is the major contributor to global warming, as well as the majority of plant food production goes towards feeding the animals instead of us (incredibly inefficient as it takes more plant products and energy emissions to eat animal products, than to just eat plant based ones). One cow takes 2 acres of land to raise and feed, that same land could grow enough plant food to feed a small village. Animal agriculture also produces a lot of feces and waste products, which then go into our air and water supply, creating new parasites and viruses that are wreaking havoc on our health, their health, and the environment. Most importantly, animal agriculture is simply not sustainable — [John McDougal puts it bluntly albeit correctly and appropriately urgently](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/80346233429/john-mcdougall-md-the-diet-wars-the-best): "(sic.) If you want to consume animal products, pick 9 of your friends that also want to eat animal products, and shoot them dead so you can continue your ways. It's better them, than your carnist mindset killing everyone."

### Non-Organics and Seafood
The world's oceans are collapsing. Not their on the verge of collapse, or will collapse soon, but are actually collapsing NOW, all due to the desire for seasfood and non-organic farming. There is nothing that can possibly compare to the destruction we are doing to the oceans and consequently the world by supporting the fishing industry and non-organic farming.

### Gentically Modified
Genetically modified foods can actually be patented by big corporations, this means that farmers must pay licensing fees to use GMO crops, and if your organic crop accidentally gets contamaintated by a neighbouring GMO farm, then you get sued. This is terrible for organic farmers that are trying to grow healthy, ethical, and ecological food.

### Non-Organics, Monocultures and Bees
@TODO Talk about non-organic food, trademarked life and patent infrigement against farmers, and how monocultures are killing the bees.


## Ethical
[This is just a small summary, get the complete ethical listing.](http://balupton.tumblr.com/tagged/ethics)

### Meat, Diary, Eggs, Fur, Leather, Science, Strays, Entertainment
Fish, cows, pigs, chickens, just like any other sentient being all feel pain, fear, and terror just like the rest of us. If you kill them, it is murder, and at the scales it is conducted, it is the world's largest holocaust, every single day.

- [Watch the video that started the live export ban "Stories from Indonesia - Live Export Investigation" for letting us realise that non-human animals are people fighting for their lives](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/64768987175/stories-from-indonesia-live-export-investigation)
- [Watch the "Earthlings" documentry to realise the horror of the animal industry that we cause](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/64768876126/earthlings-full-length-documentary)

### Dairy, Milk, Cheese, Whey
Milk-cows on average live 4 years out of there 20 year lifecycle due to the extreme strain non stop milk producing has on their body. They are also forcibly impregnated to keep them producing milk and as such have their baby's taken from them at birth (who then are enslaved into the milk industry, or improsened to wind up slaughtered for their meat) something the cow's literally scream about for days. Despite all of the cow's hormones you ingest when drinking milk, as well as the protein problems (discussed in health section), milk is also legally allowed to have a droplet of pus in it for each glass, yummy.

### Cheese
Unless otherwise stated, cheeses require taking an enzyme (rennet) from the stomachs of calves (often once they have been slaughtered for meat produce).

### Eggs
Female chickens lay eggs, but male chickens don't. So how do you keep a fresh supply of female chickens ready to lay eggs? You put the male chicks in a grinder at birth. Free range or not, this is the industry approved standard for disposing of worthless male chickens.

- [Watch the egg industry in action](http://h.lupton.cc/post/58052411547/if-it-cant-lay-eggs-it-isnt-profitable-to-the)

### Honey, Beeswax, Pollon
@TODO talk about the devestation farming bees has on them and why their enslavement does not justify your bee products, as well as the lack of evidence on their actual health benefits (just superstitions promoted by the bee industry)

### Fish
A lot of people believe that fishing is the kindest form of hunting, but this simply isn't true. Fish are actually found to have way more intense pain receptors than humans do. The reason for the easy exploitation is that once upon a time, they were abundant, but now that is not so, and it's much easier to teach children to kill an animal that can't scream in pain, versus one that can. Just because it can't scream, or verbally gasp for air, doesn't mean it isn't dying to do so, which it is.

## Health
[This is just a small summary, get the complete health listing.](http://balupton.tumblr.com/tagged/health)

### Animal Products (Meat, Dairy, Fish, etc)
Animal products cause 15/16 of the leading causes of death. It is even accepted that animal protein is toxic to the body. Plus the only way you get non-trivial amounts of cholesterol is from animal products, and one does not need to process their plant nutrients through an animal, they can eat the plants directly to get a dramatic advantage.

@TODO talk about FUD around complete VS incomplete proteins.

### Seafood (including Fish and Krill Oils)
Seafood also has the added benefit that our oceans are our toxic waste dumps, as such, the question isn't "do I get toxic chemicals in me like mercury, uranium, etc by eating fish" but rather "how much toxic chemicals do I get?" - this is also why you get Fish Oil in the pharmaceutical section, and Flax Seed Oil in the health food section, the pharmaceutical industry have an invested interest in your ill-health.

### Stress, tiredness and over-eating
40% of the average American's stress comes from poor nutrition, when stressed we don't get good quality sleep, and consume more stimulants (sugar, coffee, calories, etc) which is treating the symptoms. By improving nutrition (by eating nutrient-dense foods - not calorie dense foods) we reduce stress, sleep better, perform better, and live happier.

- [This TEDx talk by vegan athlete Brendan Brazier covers this incredibly well](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/64769601126/find-your-athletic-edge-brendan-brazier-at).

### Erectyle Dysfunction
The first thing to go from eating animal products is your erections.

## FAQ

### Ethical; Murder is made up, we call things murder where it is convenient, no one has the right to life
If I tried to put you on my bbq, you'd fight for your life. Same for animals.

For plants, it requires our empathy to extend to the wellbeing of ecology, of the planet, of everything within it.

We can't stop our harm, but we can certainly minimise it.


### Ethical; We still murder plants, why not animals?
It is not about [maximising our murder](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/78297493011/joel-salatin-of-polyface-farm-uses-we-murder), but [minimising it](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/70074081942/veganism-its-about-reducing-our-harm). We do not require to enslave, torture and murder animals for their products and by-products (which kills more plants and animals), instead we can choose plant based alternatives (which saves more plants and animals).


### General; The disadvantaged can only afford junk food
Incorrect in ALL aspects. Plants provide [more bang for the buck](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/79551721462/best-nutrition-bang-for-your-buck-nutritionfacts-org) in nutrition, quantity, weight, everything except calories when compared to animal products, even despite the [majority of animal subsidies in place](http://meatonomics.com/2013/09/28/10-things-i-wish-all-americans-knew-about-the-meat-dairy-industries/). In fact, if you also weigh in how much the medicine it costs to not die from the health issues of animal products, plant based eating is way cheaper. And finally, when you consider [animal products cause 15/16 of the leading causes of death](http://balupton.tumblr.com/post/79549201711/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death-a), it's a no-brainer when you factor in the cost of your own life.

TLDR; If you spend the exact same amount on plants, you'll still get more & eat healthier, won't require meds, and live longer.


### Ethical; Living a good life, then killed when we're ready (not it), is fine
False. Can I use that rationale on you? or your child? when I'm ready to have you on my plate or enslave you into a life of producing by-products for me - this is enslavement, in the same way we use to enslave other humans, it is treating others as merely existing to be servants for ourselves. In regards to humans better than animals, it is defined as speciesm. Watch the Earthlings movie to make the connection why this is not okay. The other issue here, while non-vegans can all hope this is the case, it unfortunately isn't. Farmed animals live horrible lives of pain and misery, to only die excrutiating deaths time and time again. If you abide by eating animals, you simply cannot guarantee this arguments truth, and is it worth risking causing any suffering, when it is so easy to switch?

### Ethical and Ecological; All this focus on animals detracts from more important issues
False. Ignoring any issue, allows it to run rampant and opens the door for more exploitation. We must address all issues together, especially as they are all interelated. Think of it as building a boat, any cracks in it will make it leak, we must fix all cracks together to ensure the boat does the best it can.

### Ethical and Ecological; We kill animals while making way for farming, so less crops the better right
True, and that is the problem. The majority of our plant based food does not go towards feeding ourselves, but feeding farmed animals instead - a highly inefficient process. If we all went vegan, we would not only be able to feed the entire world (ending poverty) with less land (consequently killing less animals, from farming, and eating) but also help to eliminate global warming and health problems signifcantly.
