# A comparison of animal vs plant products

For those raising questions about the comparison between plant products and animal products (as you should! always important to make informed decisions), here is the criteria I used:


## Ecology
### All Animals
Animal production for our benefit is the major contributor to global warming, as well as the majority of plant food production goes towards feeding the animals instead of us (incredibly inefficient it takes more plant products and energy emissions to eat animal products, than to just eat plant based ones). Their excrements and waste products are also creating new parasites that are wreaking havoc on the environment. More info via the free pamphlet [Eating Up The World: The Environmental Consequences of Human Food Choices](http://www.vnv.org.au/site/htmfiles/eatinguptheworld.htm) and [Gary Yourofsky's "The Greatest Talk You'll Ever Hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4)

### Fish & Seafood Specifically
[This TED talk by narine ecologist Jeremy Jackson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0VHC1-DO_8) exposes the extreme devastation the fishing industry is bringing to our world. There is nothing that can possibly compare to the destruction we are doing to the oceans and consequently the world by supporting the fishing industry.


## Ethical
### Meat, Fur, Leather, Science
Fish, cows, pigs, chickens, just like any other sentient being all feel pain, fear, and terror just like the rest of us. For more on the ethical aspect. [Help make the connection by watching the free on YouTube feature length film; Earthlings.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4DJh-L7Ys)

### Milk
Milk-cows on average live 4 years out of there 20 year lifecycle due to extreme strain non stop milk producing has their body. They are also forcibly impregnated to keep them producing milk and as such have their baby's taken from them at birth (who then are enslaved into the milk industry, or improsened to wind up slaughtered for their meat) something the cow's literally scream about for days. Despite all of the cow's hormounes you ingest when drinking milk, as well as the protein problems (discussed in health section), milk is also legally allowed to have a droplet of pus in it for each glass, yummy. For more information, see [Gary Yourofsky's "The Greatest Talk You'll Ever Hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4).

### Cheese
Unless otherwise stated, cheeses require taking an enzyme (rennet) from the stomachs of calves (often once they have been slaughtered for meat produce). [Read up on rennet on Wikipedia](http://h.lupton.cc/post/60622814872/rennet-wikipedia-the-free-encyclopedia) and [if you can't give up cheese, then give up cruelty instead](http://h.lupton.cc/post/60620960196/i-couldnt-give-up-cheese-so-i-gave-up-animal-cruelty).

### Eggs
Female chickens lay eggs, but male chickens don't. So how do you keep a fresh supply of female chickens ready to lay eggs? You put the male chicks in a grinder at birth. Free range or not, this is the industry approved standard for disposing of worthless male chickens. [More info here.](http://h.lupton.cc/post/58052411547/if-it-cant-lay-eggs-it-isnt-profitable-to-the)


## Health
The major causes of death are those induced by animal products, the only way you get cholesterol is from animal products, adding onto this, it is now accepted (despite the populace's ignorance) that animal protein is toxic to the body. Fish also has the added benefit that our oceans are our toxic waste dumps, as such, the question isn't "do I get toxic chemicals in me like mercury, uranium, etc by eating fish" but rather "how much toxic chemicals do I get?" - this is also why you get Fish Oil in the pharmaceutical section, and Flax Seed Oil in the health food section, the pharmaceutical industry have an invested interest in your ill-health. For more information on all of this, see [Forks over Knives (movie)](http://www.forksoverknives.com/) and [The China Study (book)](http://www.thechinastudy.com/) be sure to read the [praise section](http://www.thechinastudy.com/the-china-study/praise/) to remove all doubt about this study's credibility.
