# A comparison of animal vs plant products

For those raising questions about the comparison between plant products and animal products (as you should! always important to make informed decisions), here is the criteria I used:


## Goals
This listing/comparison aims to be an argument proof factual listing of things going on, with the hopes remove all misinformation about plants vs animal products beyond and reasonable doubt. Constructive positive comments welcome below. If you have something negative to say, try and think of an educational way of putting it, rather than an ego stroking "I'm right, you're wrong way" that just causes unecessary defenses. Thanks!


## Ecology
### All Animals
Animal production for our benefit is the major contributor to global warming, as well as the majority of plant food production goes towards feeding the animals instead of us (incredibly inefficient it takes more plant products and energy emissions to eat animal products, than to just eat plant based ones). Their excrements and waste products are also creating new parasites that are wreaking havoc on the environment. More info via the free pamphlet [Eating Up The World: The Environmental Consequences of Human Food Choices](http://www.vnv.org.au/site/htmfiles/eatinguptheworld.htm) and [Gary Yourofsky's "The Greatest Talk You'll Ever Hear"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4)

### Non-Organics and Seafood
[This TED talk by marine ecologist Jeremy Jackson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0VHC1-DO_8) exposes the extreme devastation caused by the fishing industry and non-organic farming. There is nothing that can possibly compare to the destruction we are doing to the oceans and consequently the world by supporting the fishing industry and non-organic farming.

### Non-Organics, Monocultures and Bees
@TODO Talk about non-organic food, and monocultures are killing the bees.


## Ethical
### Meat, Diary, Eggs, Fur, Leather, Science, Strays, Entertainment
Fish, cows, pigs, chickens, just like any other sentient being all feel pain, fear, and terror just like the rest of us. [Help make the connection by watching the free on YouTube feature length film; Earthlings.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4DJh-L7Ys)

### Dairy, Milk, Cheese, Whey
Milk-cows on average live 4 years out of there 20 year lifecycle due to the extreme strain non stop milk producing has on their body. They are also forcibly impregnated to keep them producing milk and as such have their baby's taken from them at birth (who then are enslaved into the milk industry, or improsened to wind up slaughtered for their meat) something the cow's literally scream about for days. Despite all of the cow's hormones you ingest when drinking milk, as well as the protein problems (discussed in health section), milk is also legally allowed to have a droplet of pus in it for each glass, yummy. For more information, see [Gary Yourofsky's "The Greatest Talk You'll Ever Hear"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4).

### Cheese
Unless otherwise stated, cheeses require taking an enzyme (rennet) from the stomachs of calves (often once they have been slaughtered for meat produce). [Read up on rennet on Wikipedia](http://h.lupton.cc/post/60622814872/rennet-wikipedia-the-free-encyclopedia) and [if you can't give up cheese, then give up cruelty instead](http://h.lupton.cc/post/60620960196/i-couldnt-give-up-cheese-so-i-gave-up-animal-cruelty).

### Eggs
Female chickens lay eggs, but male chickens don't. So how do you keep a fresh supply of female chickens ready to lay eggs? You put the male chicks in a grinder at birth. Free range or not, this is the industry approved standard for disposing of worthless male chickens. [More info here.](http://h.lupton.cc/post/58052411547/if-it-cant-lay-eggs-it-isnt-profitable-to-the)

### Honey, Beeswax, Pollon
@TODO talk about the devestation farming bees has on them and why their enslavement does not justify your bee products, as well as the lack of evidence on their actual health benefits (just superstitions promoted by the bee industry)


## Health
### Animal Protein (Meat, Dairy, Fish, etc)
The major causes of death are those induced by animal products, the only way you get non-trivial amounts of cholesterol is from animal products, adding onto this, it is now accepted (despite the populace's ignorance) that animal protein is toxic to the body. For more information on all of this, see [Forks over Knives (movie)](http://www.forksoverknives.com/) and [The China Study (book)](http://www.thechinastudy.com/) be sure to read the [praise section](http://www.thechinastudy.com/the-china-study/praise/) to remove all doubt about this study's credibility.

@TODO talk about FUD around complete VS incomplete proteins.

### Seafood (including Fish and Krill Oils)
Seafood also has the added benefit that our oceans are our toxic waste dumps, as such, the question isn't "do I get toxic chemicals in me like mercury, uranium, etc by eating fish" but rather "how much toxic chemicals do I get?" - this is also why you get Fish Oil in the pharmaceutical section, and Flax Seed Oil in the health food section, the pharmaceutical industry have an invested interest in your ill-health. Learn more about the devastations with [This TED talk by marine ecologist Jeremy Jackson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0VHC1-DO_8) as well as [the supriority of Flaxseed Oil over Fish Oil in regards to health](http://www.udoerasmus.com/articles/udo/fish_oil.htm).

### Stress, tiredness and over-eating
40% of the average American's stress comes from poor nutrition, when stressed we don't get good quality sleep, and consume more stimulants (sugar, coffee, calories, etc) which is treating the symptoms. By improving nutrition (by eating nutrient-dense foods - not calorie dense foods) we reduce stress, sleep better, perform better, and live happier. [This TEDx talk by vegan athlete Brendan Brazier covers this incredibly well](http://youtu.be/Jqpjap8rewo).

### Erectyle Dysfunction
The first thing to go from eating animal products is your erections. [Watch Rip Esselstyn explain the connection with the TED Talk "Plant-strong & healthy living" at TEDxFremont](http://youtu.be/AAkEYcmCCCk?t=6m26s).


## Coupouts

### Ethical; We kill insects every day, why not animals?
It is not about maximising our murder, but eliminating as much as we can. We do not require to enslave, torture and murder animals for their products and by-products, instead we can choose plant based alternatives.

### Ethical; Living a good life, then killed when we're ready (not it), is fine
False. Can I use that rationale on you? or your child? when I'm ready to have you on my plate or enslave you into a life of producing by-products for me - this is enslavement, in the same way we use to enslave other humans, it is treating others as merely existing to be servants for ourselves. In regards to humans better than animals, it is defined as speciesm. Watch the Earthlings movie to make the connection why this is not okay. The other issue here, while non-vegans can all hope this is the case, it unfortunately isn't. Farmed animals live horrible lives of pain and misery, to only die excrutiating deaths time and time again. If you abide by eating animals, you simply cannot guarantee this arguments truth, and is it worth risking causing any suffering, when it is so easy to switch?

### Ethical and Ecological; All this focus on animals detracts from more important issues
False. Ignoring any issue, allows it to run rampant and opens the door for more exploitation. We must address all issues together, especially as they are all interelated. Think of it as building a boat, any cracks in it will make it leak, we must fix all cracks together to ensure the boat does the best it can.

### Ethical and Ecological; We kill animals while making way for farming, so less crops the better right
True, and that is the problem. The majority of our plant based food does not go towards feeding ourselves, but feeding farmed animals instead - a highly inefficient process. If we all went vegan, we would not only be able to feed the entire world (ending poverty) with less land (consequently killing less animals, from farming, and eating) but also help to eliminate global warming and health problems signifcantly.

### Ecological and Ethical; Cutting out meat eliminates most ecological downsides, so it is still okay to consume animal by-products (dairy, egss, honey, etc)
False. It turns out that those who eliminate meat but continue to consume animal by-products actually consume a lot more than usual, adding to the same (if not higher) ecological footprint. It also is a justification for knowing what is best, but utilizing moral jumps for not doing it (see ethical copouts for arguments there). It also completely avoids the health and ethical sides of farming animals - which are incredibly important - while as explained falls short of explaining the ecological aspect. We know what will reduce ecological, ethical, and health footprints the most, and it is an easy switch, time to pull the trigger.

### Ethical; Being vegetarian is enough
As great a step as being vegetarian is, it isn't the end goal to stopping animal cruelty. What happens to the male chicks that are inevitably born to produce more egg laying hens? They get put into a grinder, free range doesn't matter. What happens to the cows to keep producing milk? They get forcibly impregnated with their children being stolen away from them at birth, enslaved to a life of milk producing or off'd to the meet industry. Animal cruelty doesn't stop with murder and meat; it stops with enslavement. Watch Gary Yourofsky's "The Greatest Talk You'll Ever Hear" for the next step.
